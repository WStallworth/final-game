# final-game
My game is entitled "Ore Quest"!  The goal is to collect all four ores by completing their respective level.  You must collect the ores in order - that being: Bronze, Iron, Gold, and Emerald.
When you complete a level by killing the required number of enemies(score shown in upper righthand corner) the level will end and you will see the ore in the bottom left corner of the main village.
When you start the game you will be in the main village, and there will be two houses.  The house on the left is level selection, and the house on the right is a quick how to play.
To move your character use the WASD keys. This game also employs mouse motion and clicking on enemies to kill them.
The first three levels introduce a new ability. These abilities are keybound as such: Q = Melee, F= Fireball, E = Wall Build. The currently equiped ability is at the top of the screen in each level.
Occasionally you will see blue potions drop in each level.  These will heal you for three lives.
If you choose to play again, you can replay the levels in any order.  You do not have to go ore by ore again.
